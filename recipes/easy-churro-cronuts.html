    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These easy churro cronuts are deep fried crescent roll doughnuts with a cinnamon sugar topping. Made with convenient refrigerated crescent roll dough, it's easy to satisfy a craving without going to the bakery.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) cans refrigerated crescent dough sheets</li>
        <li>4 cups oil, or as needed, for frying</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>Chocolate sauce or chocolate hazelnut spread for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove dough from each can and unroll to a rectangular shape. Fold the shorter end of 1 sheet up 1/3 of the way. Fold the opposite edge 1/3 of the way to fold over (and cover) the first fold. The dough should have 3 layers. Use a 3-inch cutter to cut 3 circles from the dough. Form the scraps into another layered piece and cut out one more circle. Repeat with the remaining dough sheet.  Use a smaller cutter to cut the center out of each circle to form a donut shape and reserve for donut holes. </li>
            <li>Fill a large saucepan halfway with oil and place over medium-high heat to reach a temperature of 350 to 365 degrees F (175 to 183 degrees C). Line a tray with paper towels. </li>
            <li>Combine sugar and cinnamon in a shallow dish; set aside. </li>
            <li>Working with 2 to 3 cronuts at a time, carefully lower each cronut into the hot oil. Fry about 1 minute, rotating occasionally, until browned evenly. Drain briefly on the prepared tray. While donuts are still hot, coat evenly in cinnamon sugar. Repeat with remaining cronuts and doughnut holes.</li>
            <li>Serve with chocolate sauce or hazelnut spread for dipping.</li>
        </ol>
