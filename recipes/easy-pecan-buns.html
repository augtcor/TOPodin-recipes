    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Made with just Hawaiian rolls, pecans, and a homemade sticky sauce, this 30-minute breakfast couldn't be easier to make at home. Talk about sweet!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped pecans</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 (12-count)-package Hawaiian rolls</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 8x8 cake pan with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Combine butter, sugar, salt, and honey in a pan set over medium heat. Stir while cooking until the sugar dissolves and mixture starts to bubble a little bit, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and add vanilla bean paste, heavy cream, and chopped pecans. Mix until the pecans are fully coated and set aside to cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Pour all of the sauce in the pan into the prepared cake pan and spread it out into an even layer. Add Hawaiian rolls, top side down.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is very bubbly and the buns are slightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let it cool for up to 5 minutes before flipping onto a cutting board or plate.</li>
        </ol>
